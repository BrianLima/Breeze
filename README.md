#### The Goal: 
> To create a material design themed Game Launcher with multiple view types to display the games. The user can add all of their games and launch them from one central location. Supports .exe and .lnk (shortcuts). 
This isn't designed to be a competitor to steam, or any other game launcher. I just struggled to find a material designed themed launcher that was customisable for me.

#### Current features: 
> Users can add games manually, and they will be displayed on all views

> Users can delete games, and edit existing games

> User can change the theme to dark theme

#### Not working: 
> Sidebar genre filtering

#### Planned updates:
- Genre filtering from hamburger menu
- Changing primary/accent colour from settings menu (MDIX 2.6.0)
- Add/Remove genres from the list
- Scraping images and user can select which to download
