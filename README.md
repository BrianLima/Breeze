#### The Goal: 
> To create a material design themed Game Launcher with multiple view types to display the games. The user can add all of their games and launch them from one central location. Supports .exe and .lnk (shortcuts). 
This isn't designed to be a competitor to steam, or any other game launcher. I just struggled to find a material designed themed launcher that was customisable for me.

#### Current features: 
> Users can add games manually, and they will be displayed on all views

> Users can delete games, and edit existing games

> User can change the theme to dark theme

> User can filter from the sidebar in test build, requires searching in search bar first

#### Planned updates:
- Changing primary/accent colour from settings menu (MDIX 2.6.0)
- Scraping images and user can select which to download
